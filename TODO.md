- Use trading view to send buy and sell calls
- Partial buy and sell
- Predict stoploss
- Use multiple indicators and give them priority or waitage
- Macro analysis for specific sectors like IT, electronics, pharma, consumer,
  bank, etc

#### Import orders
- Import csv files which are exported from brokers like Zerodha to populate the
  orders table

#### Profit and Loss Chart
- Portfolio for showing overall Profit and Loss
- Daily candlestick chart for profit and loss

#### Financial Calculator
- Sip calculator, select index or equity, select time duration, select amount
  per month, select amount growth % per month, calculate the final return
  compared to the total amount invested
- Cycle through daily, weekly, monthly candle data and check for candlestick
  patterns
